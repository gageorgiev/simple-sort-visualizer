## Simple Sort Vizualizer
This project aims to provide a tool for vizualizing different sorting algorithms. Currently the algorithms that are available are Bubble sort, Quick sort, Heap sort, Gnome sort and Odd-Even sort.

It is implemented in React with additional styling provided by TailwindCSS.

## Purpose
The purpose was to strengthen my skills in React and sharpen my grasp of sorting algorithms. Also a sorting visualizer seems like the kind of project that should appear in every new developer's portfolio.
