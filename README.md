## Simple Sort Vizualizer

https://gabrielgeorgiev1998.github.io/simple-sort-visualizer

This project aims to provide a tool for vizualizing different sorting algorithms. Currently the algorithms that are available are Bubble sort, Quick sort, in-place Merge sort, Heap sort, Gnome sort and Odd-Even sort.

It is implemented in React with additional styling provided by TailwindCSS.


## Purpose
The purpose was to strengthen my skills in React and sharpen my grasp of sorting algorithms. Also a sorting visualizer seems like the kind of project that should appear in every new developer's portfolio.
